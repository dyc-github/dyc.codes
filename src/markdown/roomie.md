# Roomie 

The Roomie app, was a personal project I worked on with three of my roommates, that aims to make co-living more enjoyable and organized. The app was mainly a learning experience to get better at programming.

## Design and Planning

I had designed the app in Figma making use of Googleâ€™s material UI.

The app combines shared todo lists, shared calendars, messaging, and peer-to-peer transactions into one app. Shared todo lists allow users to collaboratively create and manage tasks, ensuring a fair distribution of responsibilities. The shared calendar feature enables synchronized scheduling, keeping everyone informed about important events and shared activities. Additionally, we included messaging to communication within the app, making it easy for roommates to stay connected.

## Development

The Roomie app was built using React Native as it was easy transition for those with web development experience. We utilized Firebase Authentication and Firestore for user authentication and data storage. Both the onboarding process and the messaging features of the app are fully functional. Unfortunately due to time constraints we were unable to get much further but you can see our work here.

## Conclusion

The Roomie app, a fun and educational personal project that I pursued with my roommates. With its shared todo lists, shared calendars, and messaging features, Roomie offers a convenient and effective way to enhance co-living experiences.
