# Hack Merced

While studying at the University of California, Merced I served as an organizer for HackMerced, the biggest Hackathon in the San Joaquin Valley. Notable achievements while I was there included…

- Creating and maintaining [hackmerced.com](https://hackmerced.com/)
- Running workshops on Firebase and React Native
- Both hosting and participating in Hack Merced VIII

## Working on hackmerced.com

I originally joined the HackMerced team as a frontend developer for the HackMerced site. The site was developed using React.js and the MUI library. Although this was my first React.js project, I was able to take what I knew from React Native and vanilla web development to learn and adapt quickly. In fact [dyc.codes](http://dyc.codes) was actually developed using React.js.

Me and the rest of the engineering team split up the work so that the website was developed quickly. I was primarily responsible for FAQ section of the site. You can find our work at [hackmerced.com](https://hackmerced.com/)

## Workshops

As a club officer I also created and ran workshops for Hack Merced’s events.

**Firebase**

I taught student’s how to use Firebase as a backend to create a login and comments section.

Using firebase authentication students were able to add and verify users. I also taught them how to use firestore to save user and display user comments live. You can see the workshop [here](https://complete-serpent-bd9.notion.site/Firebase-Auth-Firestore-503c37fa10244e74926626767a2bd3de).

**React Native**

I’ve actually ran two React Native Workshops for Hack Merced. The first was the for Hack Merced VIII where I taught students to develop a simple todo app.

Aside from needing some basic programming experience the workshop was designed to teach complete beginners everything they needed to know to make their own app. The React Native todo workshop can be seen here.

My todo workshop had actually ran overtime, so I revised it to be simpler for when we partnered with CITRIS for the Secure Water Future Hackathon. There I taught students to create a simple counting app.

The goal of this workshop was the same, to teach complete beginners how to build their first app in React Native, but was adapted to fit the time constraints of this new hackathon. This workshop can be seen [here](https://complete-serpent-bd9.notion.site/React-Native-Tally-Counter-App-22e4735be60b433eaa3da8dc91bb7e69).

## Hack Merced VIII

Outside of the workshops I helped organize and run Hack Merced VIII with my team. This primarily meant promoting the hackathon, doing general event work, and supporting students with their projects. Thanks to our collaborative effort we were able to host over 250 students with sponsorships from Wolfram, JetBrains, HashiCorp and more.

In addition to being a organizer, I was also a hackathon participant leading a team of 4 to build a simple recipe website called Benson Cooks. The website takes ingredients to include and exclude and provides a list of recipes.

The purpose of the project was to learn, as many members of my team were new to web development. We used HTML, Javascript, and CSS in addition to the spoonacular API to create the site. You can learn more about the project [here](https://devpost.com/software/benson-cooks).

## Conclusion

My time at Hack Merced was filled with equal parts learning and teaching. It was my first time running an event at this scale and I’m happy to have done it with such a supportive and amazing team. Furthermore, having the opportunity to take what I know and teach both new and experienced programmers provided me with a sense of gratification like no other. Although I’m leaving Merced I won’t be leaving the community and I’ll take what I’ve learned no matter where I am.
