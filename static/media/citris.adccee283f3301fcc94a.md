## Introduction

Working as a Web Developer Intern at CITRIS and the Banatao Institute at UC Merced was an enriching experience that allowed me to contribute to impactful projects and enhance my skills in web development.

## Maintaining the CITRIS website

One of my primary responsibilities during my internship was maintaining the main UC Merced CITRIS website. This involved creating new pages for upcoming events and research news, as well as implementing UI changes to improve the user experience. Through my work, I helped ensure that the website remained up-to-date and engaging for visitors. The site was maintained using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.

## Creating the F3 website

My main project was while working at CITRIS was spearheading the development F3: Fresno-Merced Future of Food Innovation Initiative website. This involved creating an entirely new website from scratch using React.js. The aim of this project was to inform Central Valley residents and the wider public about the work F3 is doing with 65 million dollars of government funding.

Collaboration played a vital role in my experience working at CITRIS. While working on the F3 website, I worked closely with Alonso Ortiz. Together, we formed a cohesive team where I took the lead in designing the pages using Figma and overseeing the project's progress. Additionally, I guided Alonso in learning React.js, enabling him to implement the challenge grant and news pages while I worked on the home, people, and contact pages. The result of our work can be seen here at [f3.ucmerced.edu](https://f3.ucmerced.edu/)
